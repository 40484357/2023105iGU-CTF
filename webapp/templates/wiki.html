Any small change to the input will change the hash value significantly.<br><br>MD5 is mainly used to verify the integrity of a file and it is faster to generate. It is an insecure algorithm as it can lead to collisions, which means two different inputs of data can generate the same MD5 hash value and with modern computers it can be easily attacked.'

It provides organisations with valuable insights and operational intelligence by transforming raw data into meaningful and actionable information. It can be used for cybersecurity, compliance, data pipelines, IT operations, intelligence, monitoring or business management. By offering real-time insights, Splunk empowers industries to make data-driven decisions, enhance operational efficiency, ensure security, and deliver improved user experiences.<br><br>Founded in 2003, Splunk is a global company  — with over 7,500 employees. The platform uses its own query language - SPL (Search Processing Language). It is a domain-specific language tailored for data analysis, making it easier for both technical and non-technical users to gain insights from their data without requiring extensive programming skills.<br><br>An example of a splunk query is:<br><br>index=security sourcetype=auth (event_type=login OR event_type=failed_login)<br>| stats count by user, event_type<br>| sort - count<br>| where event_type="failed_login"<br><br>In this example, the query searches for authentication events in the specified index and sourcetype. It then calculates the count of successful logins and failed login attempts for each user. The results are sorted in descending order based on the count of failed login attempts, and the query filters the results to show only rows related to failed login events.<br><br>An index in Splunk is a repository or storage location where the raw data is stored. For example, there might be different indexes for security-related data, application logs, network logs etc. This separation allows to control retention policies, access permissions, and data management strategies for different types of data.<br><br>A sourcetype in Splunk is a metadata attribute assigned to incoming data to identify its source or format. It provides information about how the data should be parsed, categorised, and processed during indexing. Sourcetypes help Splunk understand the structure of the data, enabling it to extract fields and create events from the raw data.'

The main purpose of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange is the ability to establish secure communications over public channels between two parties that don’t know each other. Generally, it's used for encryption, password-authenticated key agreement and forward security. Password-authenticated key agreements are used to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Forward secrecy-based protocols protect against the compromising of keys by generating new key pairs for each session.<br><br>Diffie-Hellman key exchange is commonly found in security protocols, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure Shell (SSH) and IP Security (IPsec).<br><br>Example:<br>Step 1: Bob and Alice get public numbers N = 541, G = 10<br><br>Step 2: Bob selected a private key X = 5 and Alice selected a private key Y = 7<br><br>Step 3: Bob and Alice compute public values<br>Bob: A=G^x mod N; A = (10^5 mod 541) = 456<br>Alice: B=G^y mod N; B=(10^97 mod 541) = 156<br><br>Step 4: Alice and Bob exchange public numbers (456 and 156)<br><br>Step 5: Bob and Alice compute same shared symmetric keys<br>Bob: key = B^x mod N = 92389579776 mod 541 = 193<br>Alice: key = A^y mod N = 4099717187644686336 mod 541 = 193<br><br>Step 6: 193 is the shared secret.<br><br>For Further details check out: https://asecuritysite.com/keyexchange/diffie"

It enables users to hide nearly any type of digital content, such as text, images, videos, or audio, within other digital content, making detection difficult. The hidden data, often referred to as hidden text, is usually encrypted or processed to heighten its concealment.<br><br>Steganography serves various purposes, including conveying secret messages or codes. While it has legitimate applications, it has also been exploited by malware developers to hide malicious code transmissions.Today, steganography finds use in watermarking, a technique that embeds identifying data or trademarks in multimedia files. Online publishers employ watermarking to track unauthorised sharing of media files. A common application involves embedding a text file within an image, imperceptibly altering less significant bits in the data to accommodate the hidden message. This can be done manually or with steganography tools.<br><br>Steganography differs from cryptography but can complement it to enhance data security and evade detection. Encrypting steganographically-hidden data maintains its secrecy, although the channel itself may become vulnerable. The key advantage of steganography paired with encryption is its ability to obscure the presence of sensitive data within the carrier file or content. Unlike encrypted files that are marked as such, steganography maintains the secrecy of the secure channel."

An essential characteristic of AES lies in its symmetric nature. In this framework, the same key is employed for both encrypting and decrypting data. This key must be shared and utilised by both the sender and recipient.<br><br>AES operates through three distinct block ciphers, each denoted by their key lengths:<br><br>AES-128: Utilises a 128-bit key length for the encryption and decryption of message blocks.<br>AES-192: Engages a 192-bit key length to secure message blocks through encryption and decryption.<br>AES-256: Employs a robust 256-bit key length for the encryption and decryption of message blocks.<br><br>Each cipher encrypts and decrypts data in blocks of 128 bits using cryptographic keys of 128, 192 and 256 bits, respectively.<br><br>AES encryption faces a notable risk from side-channel attacks, which aim to extract leaked information from a system to compromise AES security. They involve gathering data on a device's behaviour during cryptographic operations to reverse-engineer its cryptography system. Mitigation involves preventing data leakage avenues and using randomization techniques to disassociate cipher-protected data from leaked information, thwarting attackers' pattern deduction."
